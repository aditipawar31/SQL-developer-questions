---

### **Beginner Level**

---

#### **1. Basic SQL**

- **What is SQL, and why is it important?**
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. It's important because it helps us query, update, and organize data easily.

- **Explain the difference between `DDL` and `DML`.**
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define database structure like tables (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Used to manage data within tables (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

- **How do you create a table in SQL? Provide an example.**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
  );
  ```

- **How do you insert data into a table? Provide an example.**
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary)
  VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'Engineering', 75000);
  ```

- **What is the difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`?**
  - `DELETE` removes specific rows based on a condition.
  - `TRUNCATE` removes all rows but keeps the table structure. It's faster than `DELETE`.

- **How can you retrieve all records from a table?**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees;
  ```

- **What is the use of the `WHERE` clause in SQL?**
  The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records. For example:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
  ```

- **How would you update a record in SQL?**
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = 80000
  WHERE id = 1;
  ```

- **Explain the difference between `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`.**
  - **`GROUP BY`:** Groups rows with the same values.
  - **`ORDER BY`:** Sorts the result set.

  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT department, AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department;
  ```

- **What are SQL `JOINs`? Explain different types of joins.**
  `JOINs` are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.

  Types:
  - **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
  - **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
  - **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.

- **How do you filter records using `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`?**
  - **`LIKE`:** Finds patterns in strings. Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
    ```
  - **`BETWEEN`:** Filters within a range. Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000;
    ```
  - **`IN`:** Filters specific values. Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('Engineering', 'HR');
    ```

- **What is a `NULL` value in SQL and how do you handle it?**
  `NULL` means "no value". Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to handle it:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
  ```

- **How would you find duplicate records in a table?**
  ```sql
  SELECT name, COUNT(*)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY name
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

- **How would you retrieve only unique values from a column?**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
  ```

- **What are SQL aggregate functions?**
  These perform calculations on multiple rows:
  - `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.
  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
  ```

#### **2. Database Basics**

- **What is a primary key?**
  A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot have `NULL` values.
  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY
  );
  ```

- **What is a foreign key?**
  A foreign key links two tables together, referencing the primary key of another table.
  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    employee_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
  );
  ```

- **What are constraints in SQL?**
  Constraints enforce rules at the column level, like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`.

- **What is a view in SQL?**
  A view is a saved SQL query that acts like a table. Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW employee_salaries AS
  SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
  ```

- **What are indexes in SQL?**
  Indexes speed up data retrieval. Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees (name);
  ```

- **Explain normalization.**
  Normalization is organizing data to reduce redundancy. It improves efficiency.

- **What are the different normal forms?**
  - **1NF:** Eliminate duplicate columns.
  - **2NF:** Remove partial dependencies.
  - **3NF:** Remove transitive dependencies.

- **What is denormalization?**
  Denormalization adds redundancy to improve read performance, at the cost of write efficiency.

- **Explain the ACID properties.**
  - **Atomicity:** All operations in a transaction complete or none do.
  - **Consistency:** Data remains consistent before and after the transaction.
  - **Isolation:** Transactions don't affect each other.
  - **Durability:** Changes persist after a transaction is complete.

- **What is a schema in SQL?**
  A schema is a collection of database objects like tables, views, and indexes.

### **Intermediate Level**

#### **1. SQL Queries and Optimization**

- **What is a subquery?**
  A subquery is a query inside another query. Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
  ```

- **How can you optimize SQL queries?**
  - Use indexes.
  - Avoid `SELECT *`.
  - Use `JOIN` instead of subqueries.
  - Use proper filtering with `WHERE`.

- **Explain the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`.**
  - `WHERE`: Filters before grouping.
  - `HAVING`: Filters after grouping.

  Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT department, AVG(salary)
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
  HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
  ```

- **What are window functions?**
  These perform calculations across a set of table rows. Example of `ROW_NUMBER()`:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
  FROM employees;
  ```

- **How do you perform a `UNION`?**
  Combines results from two queries. Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees
  UNION
  SELECT name FROM contractors;
  ```

- **What is a transaction?**
  A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single unit. Example:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE id = 1;
    DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 5;
  COMMIT;
  ```

- **What is indexing and how does it improve performance?**
  Indexing speeds up search queries by creating a sorted data structure on columns.

#### **2. Database Design**

- **What is an ER diagram?**
  An ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram shows the relationship between tables in a database.

- **How would you design a database for an e-commerce application?**
  Youâ€™d create tables for customers, products, orders, etc. Ensure each table has a unique identifier and relationships (e.g., `customer_id` in the `orders` table references `customers`).

- **What is a star schema?**
  In a star schema, a central fact table is connected to dimension tables, typically used in data warehousing.

- **How would you handle many-to-many relationships?**
  Use a junction table. Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE student_courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
  );
  ```

### **Advanced Level**

#### **1. Advanced SQL and Optimization**

- **What is a CTE?**
  A CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary result set that you can reference in a query. Example:
  ```sql
  WITH employee_cte AS (
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000
  )
  SELECT * FROM employee_cte;
  ```

- **What is a recursive query?**
  A

 recursive query references itself. Example:
  ```sql
  WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, manager_id FROM employees WHERE id = 1
    UNION
    SELECT e.id, e.manager_id FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
  )
  SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
  ```
